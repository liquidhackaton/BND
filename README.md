# CLPT-20XX
Here is the code for the test automation. We expect a fork of this repo with the automated tests added.

With the automated tests we expect at least the following
* Seeding database data for the customer and product to be used
* Mocks of the interaction with the third-party API

A test that proves that the user story is working as it should
1. A test case that proves that I can fetch an Incoming payment
2. A test case that proves that I can fetch a FiscalTransfer
3. A test case that proves that I can fetch an Interest payment

### Tools needed for this excercise:
